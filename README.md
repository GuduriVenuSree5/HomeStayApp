Homestay Recommendation System
Project Overview
This Homestay Recommendation System is being developed collaboratively by Likith Kandepu and Venu Sree Guduri. Our project aims to connect hosts offering homestays with tourists, providing a platform that allows both parties to interact seamlessly, with added functionality for administrators to manage and oversee the system. The project consists of three main modules: Admin, Homestay Host, and Tourist, each with distinct features to enhance user experience and system management.
